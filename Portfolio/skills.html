            <h3>C Programming</h3>
            <p>
                When I was learning this language, it was super hard. You know why?
                <br> It was my first time learning this things. I was disturbed.<br>
                But with time I learnt the beauty of C Programming.<br> Imagine having to 
                account for evry space in memory you use. <br> How awesome is that.
                <br> Then the language has a strict syntax,<br> you just don't go writing as you desire.

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>
                This is the guy in the block who doesn't seem to do a lot of things,<br>
                But somehow he has and knows a lot of things. Easy to learn, good syntax.
                <br>Overall, just learn this

                Seems to be easy going but somehow this guy moves mountains.
                <br> Ever seen a watch on a webpage?
                This guys is responsible for all that. Anyways, for interative pages, 
                JS as we call him is your guy.
