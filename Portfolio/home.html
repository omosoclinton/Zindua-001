            <h3>Best Youtube resources for coding</h3>
            <p>
                One famous person somewhere said this:
                <br> <blockquote>Youtube is the second biggest invention in the modern learning environment, after Google</blockquote>
                <br> And I agree with them. YouTube is so resourceful you can learn anything from how to bake and then eat that cake.
                <br> You can learn coding there too. The resources that have helped me are available

                <q>OMG! you're so boring</q> <br>
                I heard one of my friends being told like that by his girl. <br>
                Don't be like him there are many things to be done,especially as a programmer.
                <br> Now you want to learn how to code, but also have a life out there. <br>
