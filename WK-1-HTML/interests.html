            Do you ever sit down and wonder what life could be without football?. <br>
            Well, I've met couple of dudes who don't enjoy football.<br>
            What a loss? <br>
            Their loss though, not mine. <br>
            When your football club is leading in the L department, <br>
            you have to look for other stuff to do. <br>
            This is where hiking, fitness, and all this other stuff come in.
