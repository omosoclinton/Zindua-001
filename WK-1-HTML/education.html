        <h4>Education, but why?</h4>
        <p>
            It's been said before that education is the key. <br>
            I don't come bearing different news, just reinforcing the fact.
            <br> Education makes a person different.
            <br> The difference between an educated person and uneducated is as day and light
            <br> Education enables us to understand the world. <br>
            If you were not lucky enough to pursue education to any level, <br>
            You can always begin at any point. <br>
            Remember, it's never too late.
