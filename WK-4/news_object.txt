Launched in 2021, the project aims to promote resilience and economic recovery for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and informal businesses in the Philippines following the Covid-19 pandemic.The newly established DTC in Cotabato City will provide digital resources and training programs to support the digitalization of business operations and job creation among enterprises in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).In his remarks, First Secretary Kanno noted that while the project was initiated in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the focus on occupational safety, health, and digitalization of business operations remains vital beyond the health crisis. He expressed hope that the collaborative efforts behind the DTC's creation would continue to empower more people in the coming years, ensuring a lasting positive impact.Additionally, satellite-based internet connectivity (Starlink) and computers were handed over to five DICT Tech4ED Centers to address internet connectivity challenges. These centers are located in the BARMM municipalities of Upi, Parang, and Buldon, as well as in Region 12's General Santos City and M'lang.Japan and the ILO have a long history of collaborating on development initiatives in the Philippines, with the shared goal of improving the lives of the Filipino people.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2024-06-02 16:07:00","image_url":"https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2024/06/02/354156.jpeg","source_id":"manilatimes","source_priority":33634,"source_url":"https://www.manilatimes.net","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/manilatimes.png","language":"english","country":["philippines"],"category":["other"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS"},{"article_id":"80ff0dfd8f0b2510c42034fbe6b980d2","title":"There is currency stress on the horizon","link":"https://www.manilatimes.net/2024/06/03/business/financial-times/there-is-currency-stress-on-the-horizon/1949678","keywords":["business"],"creator":["Gillian Tett"],"video_url":null,"description":"This summer, the yen is stoking market jitters.

Madrid have now won their last nine European Cup finals and won the competition six times in the last 11 seasons.However, not for the first time in that run, they had to rely on some good fortune as underdogs Dortmund were left to bitterly regret not making the most of their first-half chances.Niclas Fuellkrug hit the post and Karim Adeyemi failed to convert a one-on-one with Thibaut Courtois.Madrid, though, always seem to find a way in Europe's elite competition and made more history in London.\"They left us alive with the game level and in the second half we started to play better,\" said Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti.\"This squad leaves me very satisfied because we don't always play our best but we never give up.\"Carvajal, Kroos, Nacho and Luka Modric joined Real legend Paco Gento as the only players to win the European Cup six times.Ancelotti also extended his record as the most successful coach in the competition's history with his fifth title.A record number of more than 2,500 stewards were in place at Wembley with the authorities keen to avoid a repeat of the violent scenes that marred the Euro 2020 final three years ago when ticketless fans stormed the turnstiles.But further questions over the security operation will be raised as three pitch invaders were able to enter the field in the opening minutes of the game, with one taking photos alongside Jude Bellingham and Vinicius.The Metropolitan Police said there had been 53 arrests, including five for pitch invasions.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2024-06-02 16:07:00","image_url":"https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2024/06/02/354216.jpg","source_id":"manilatimes","source_priority":33634,"source_url":"https://www.manilatimes.net","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/manilatimes.png","language":"english","country":["philippines"],"category":["sports"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS"},{"article_id":"cafad75bf619449007842f8e1354c53b","title":"GoTyme, CICC to step up fight against financial fraud","link":"https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/03/gotyme-cicc-to-step-up-fight-against-financial-fraud/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gotyme-cicc-to-step-up-fight-against-financial-fraud","keywords":["banking & finance"],"creator":["Lenie Lectura"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC) and GoTyme Bank vowed to intensify efforts to fight financial fraud with the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU).","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2024-06-02 16:07:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"businessmirror","source_priority":199185,"source_url":"https://businessmirror.com.ph","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/businessmirror.png","language":"english","country":["philippines"],"category":["top"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS"},{"article_id":"8d3829817907f582fea95f19039c086f","title":"Sunshine Place introduces adult ballet class","link":"https://www.manilatimes.net/2024/06/03/public-square/sunshine-place-introduces-adult-ballet-class/1949629","keywords":["public square"],"creator":["The Manila Times"],"video_url":null,"description":"SUNSHINE Place introduces \"Adult Ballet,\" a special dance class to be taught by Pamela Ramos, a longtime ballet teacher and a pioneer member of the prestigious Philippine Ballet Theater. Ballet lessons are usually offered to toddlers and kids because, at such a young age, the body can still be trained for the discipline that this type of dance requires. This is why, for some adults who have always wanted to learn ballet but are hesitant because of their age, having to learn ballet remains a far-fetched dream.At Sunshine Place, seniors can attest to the fact that learning new things late is better than not learning at all.The dance workshop, scheduled to begin on June 1 from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m., is exclusively for adults between ages 25 and 40 with little to no experience in ballet and who are interested in exploring the graceful art of classical ballet. Lessons will cover essential concepts and fundamental techniques of ballet as well as introductory elements of gymnastics to enhance flexibility and strength.By the end of the course, students will have a solid foundation in basic ballet movements and techniques. They will be prepared to perform simple ballet routines and will be ready to advance to the next level of ballet training.For more details, follow Sunshine Place on Facebook at http://www.sunshineplaceph.com/ or Instagram at @sunshineplaceph.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2024-06-02 16:07:00","image_url":"https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2024/06/02/354140.jpg","source_id":"manilatimes","source_priority":33634,"source_url":"https://www.manilatimes.net","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/manilatimes.png","language":"english","country":["philippines"],"category":["top"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS"},{"article_id":"7c6e45e06e0bcb45fdbc29c8ec919907","title":"DA creates group to craft AO 20 implementing rules","link":"https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/06/03/da-creates-group-to-craft-ao-20-implementing-rules/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=da-creates-group-to-craft-ao-20-implementing-rules","keywords":["banking & finance"],"creator":["Ada Pelonia"],"video_url":null,"description":"The Department of Agriculture (DA) created a technical working group (TWG) that would issue the implementing guidelines for streamlining administrative procedures and policies and removing non-tariff barriers to farm imports.","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","pubDate":"2024-06-02 16:07:00","image_url":null,"source_id":"businessmirror","source_priority":199185,"source_url":"https://businessmirror.com.ph","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/businessmirror.png","language":"english","country":["philippines"],"category":["top"],"ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS"}],"nextPage":"1717344420375473434"}
